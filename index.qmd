**Gillespie algorithm**

2 possible events:

-   $\mathbb{P}\text{(infection event)} = \frac{\beta \frac{I(t)}{N} S(t)}{\beta \frac{I(t)}{N} S(t) + \gamma I(t)}$
-   $\mathbb{P}\text{(removal event)} = \frac{\gamma I(t)}{\beta \frac{I(t)}{N} S(t) + \gamma I(t)}$

## Stochastic SIR models (2)

Early stage:

$I(t) = 1$, $S(t) \approx N$

$\mathbb{P}\text{(infection event)} = \frac{\beta \frac {I(t)} {N} S(t)}{\beta \frac {I(t)} {N} S(t) + \gamma I(t)} \approx \frac {\beta} {\beta + \gamma}$

$\mathbb{P}\text{(removal event)} = \frac {\gamma I(t)} {\beta \frac {I(t)} {N} S(t) + \gamma I(t)} \approx \frac {\gamma} {\beta + \gamma}$

## Stochastic SIR models (3)

Probability that 1 infected host generates k infections is:

$$\mathbb{P}(X = k) = \left( \frac{\beta}{\beta + \gamma} \right)^k \times \frac{\gamma}{\beta + \gamma}$$

* First generate k infections

* Then be removed

* The number of failures prior to the first success

* A **geometric distribution** with "success probability" $\frac {\gamma} {\beta + \gamma}$

## Methods for estimating the probability of a major outbreak

Two methods:

* Probability generating functions

* First-step analysis

## Galton-Watson branching process (1)

The early outbreak can be approximated as a **branching process**:

* Each infected individual generates a number of new infections that is drawn from the **offspring distribution**

* Assumption: All infected cases **independently** generate secondary cases (independently draws from the **offspring distribution**)

* The **offspring distribution** is **geometric distribution** (explained above)

## Galton-Watson branching process (2)

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![](img/branching_process.jpg)

* Ignore the precise times at which infections occur

* Infections can be separated into discrete generations

* **All infections generated by a specific individual** appear in the **same generation**.

:::

## Galton-Watson branching process (3)

![](img/galton_watson.png){fig-align="center"}

* Start with 1 individual at generation n = 0.

* Each individual lives 1 generation, has $Y$ offspring, and dies.

* $Y$ takes values 0, 1, 2, ..., and the probability of producing $k$ offspring is $\mathbb{P}(Y = k) = p_k$.

## Galton-Watson branching process (4)

![](img/offspring_distr.png){fig-align="center"}

* All individuals reproduce **independently**.

* Individuals 1, 2, ..., n have family sizes $Y_1$, $Y_2$, ..., $Y_n$, where each $Y_i$ has **the same offspring distribution** as $Y$.

## Extinct by generation n

Let $Z_n$ be the size of generation n.

A branching process extinct by generation n when there is 0 offspring at generation n.

Let $E_n$ be the event that there is 0 offspring at generation n, or $E_n = \{Z_n = 0\}$

$$\mathbb{P}\text{(extinct by generation n)} = \mathbb{P}(E_n) = \mathbb{P}(Z_n = 0)$$

## Ultimate extinction (1)

Ultimate extinction is probability that the population will be extinct by generation n, for any value of n. This is the probability of extinct by gen 0 **or** gen 1 **or** gen 2...

$$\mathbb{P}\text{(ultimate extinction)} = \mathbb{P} \left( \bigcup_{n = 0}^\infty E_n \right)$$

## Ultimate extinction (2)

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![](img/union_extinct.png)

$E_0 \subseteq E_1 \subseteq E_2 \subseteq E_3$... ($E_0$ is a subset of $E_1$ and so on). We obtain the union when reach *generation $\infty$*

:::

## Ultimate extinction (3)

$$\mathbb{P}\text{(ultimate extinction)} = \mathbb{P}(\lim_{n\to\infty} E_n)$$

By the Continuity Theorem: we can take the limit outside

$$\mathbb{P}(\lim_{n\to\infty} E_n) = \lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{P}(E_n) = \lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{P}(Z_n = 0)$$

So ultimate extinction is the limit of event "0 offspring at generation n", when $n \to \infty$.

## Prove: Taking the limit out

::: {.callout-note}

Let $f(x) = x^3$, $g(x) = x + 2$, find $lim_{x \to 3} f(g(x))$

There are two ways to solve this:

1. Plug $g(x) = x + 2$ inside of $f(x)$ 

$f(g(x)) = (x + 2)^3$

$lim_{x \to 3} (x + 2)^3 = 5^3 = 125$

2. Because $f(x)$ is a continuous function, we can put the $lim$ inside of $f(x)$

$lim_{x \to 3} f(g(x)) = f[lim_{x \to 3} g(x)] = f[lim_{x \to 3} (x + 2)] = f(5) = 125$

:::

## Ultimate extinction (4)

If $G_{Z_n}(s)$ is the PGF of $Z_n$ (number of offspring at generation n). 

$G_{Z_n}(s) = s^0 \mathbb{P}(Z_n = 0) + s^1 \mathbb{P}(Z_n = 1) + s^2 \mathbb{P}(Z_n = 2)..$

We have $G_{Z_n}(0) = \mathbb{P}(Z_n = 0)$.

For ease of notation, we write $G_{Z_n}(0) = G_n(0)$.

So:

$$\mathbb{P}\text{(ultimate extinction)} = \lim_{n\to\infty} G_n(0)$$

## Ultimate extinction (5)

**Theorem**

The ultimate extinction probability q is the smallest non-negative solution of the equation $G_X(q) = q$ (or the fixed point). $G_X(q)$ is the probability generating function.

## Probability generating function

![](img/offspring_distr.png){fig-align="center"}

PGF is a function that can **generate all probabilities of the distribution**.

$$G_X(s) = \mathbb{E}(s^X) = \sum_{x = 0}^\infty s^x \mathbb{P}(X = x)$$

$$G_X(s) = s^0 \mathbb{P}(X = 0) + s^1 \mathbb{P}(X = 1) + s^2 \mathbb{P}(X = 2) + ...$$

## Calculate probabilities with PGF (1)

Let $p_0 = \mathbb{P}(X = 0)$, $p_1 = \mathbb{P}(X = 1)$...

$$G_X(s) = s^0 p_0 + s^1 p_1 + s^2 p_2 + s^3 p_3 + s^4 p_4 ...$$

If $s = 0$, then $G_X(0) = 0^0 p_0 + 0^1 p_1 + 0^2 p_2 + 0^3 p_3 + ...$

Because $0^0 = 1$ and $0^1 = 0^2 = 0^3 = ... = 0$

Therefore $G(0) = p_0$

## Calculate probabilities with PGF (2)

$$G_X(s) = s^0 p_0 + s^1 p_1 + s^2 p_2 + s^3 p_3 + s^4 p_4 ...$$

First derivative: $G'_X(s) = p_1 + 2 p_2 s + 3 p_3 s^2 + 4 p_4 s^3 ...$

If $s = 0$, then $G'_X(0) = p_1$

Second derivative: $G''_X(s) = 2 p_2 + 6 p_3 s + 12 p_4 s^2 ...$

If $s = 0$, then $G''_X(0) = 2 p_2$ or $p_2 = \frac{G''_X(0)}{2}$

## PGF of geometric distribution (1)

In the SIR model, the offspring distribution is a **geometric distribution** with "success probability" $\frac {\gamma} {\beta + \gamma}$

$$G_X(s) = \mathbb{E}(s^X) = \sum_{x = 0}^\infty s^x \mathbb{P}(X = x)$$

Let $X \sim \text{Geometric(p)}$ with $p$ is the success probability

Then the PMF $\mathbb{P}(X = x) = (1 - p)^xp$ (having $x$ failures before success)

## PGF of geometric distribution (2)

$G_X(s) = \mathbb{E}(s^X) = \sum_{x = 0}^\infty s^x \mathbb{P}(X = x)$

$= \sum_{x = 0}^\infty s^x (1 - p)^x p = p \sum_{x = 0}^\infty [s(1 - p)]^x$

$= p\{[s(1 - p)]^0 + [s(1 - p)]^1 + [s(1 - p)]^2 + ...\}$

$= p[1 + s(1 - p) + [s(1 - p)]^2 + ...]$

## PGF of geometric distribution (3)

$G_X(s) = p[1 + s(1 - p) + [s(1 - p)]^2 + ...]$

We have: $1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + ... = \frac {1} {1 - r}$ with $|r| < 1$

::: {.callout-note}

$A = 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + ...$

$rA = r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4 + ...$

$\Rightarrow A - rA = 1 \Leftrightarrow A(1 - r) = 1 \Leftrightarrow A = \frac {1} {1 - r}$

:::

Here $r = s(1 - p) \Rightarrow G_X(s) = \frac{p}{1 - s(1 - p)}$

## Ultimate extinction of SIR models (1)

In the SIR model, the offspring distribution is a **geometric distribution** with "success probability" $\frac {\gamma} {\beta + \gamma}$

Also for SIR model: $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} \Rightarrow \gamma = \frac{\beta}{R_0}$

Plug $\gamma = \frac{\beta}{R_0}$ to the success probability

$\frac {\gamma} {\beta + \gamma} = \frac{\frac{\beta}{R_0}}{\beta + \frac{\beta}{R_0}} = \frac{\frac{\beta}{R_0}}{\frac{\beta(R_0 + 1)}{R_0}} = \frac{1}{R_0 + 1}$

## Ultimate extinction of SIR models (2)

Now the "success probability" is $p = \frac{1}{R_0 + 1}$

The PGF of geometric distribution is $G_X(s) = \frac{p}{1 - s(1 - p)}$

$G_X(s) = \frac{\frac{1}{R_0 + 1}}{1 - s \left( 1 - \frac{1}{R_0 + 1} \right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{R_0 + 1}}{\frac{R_0 + 1 - s(R_0 + 1 - 1)}{R_0 + 1}} = \frac{1}{R_0 + 1 - sR_0}$

Ultimate extinction probability $q$ is the solution of $G_X(q) = q$

$\Leftrightarrow \frac{1}{R_0 + 1 - qR_0} = q$

$\Leftrightarrow R_0q^2 - (R_0 + 1)q + 1 = 0$

## Ultimate extinction of SIR models (3)

$$R_0q^2 - (R_0 + 1)q + 1 = 0$$

The solutions are $q = 1$ and $q = \frac{1}{R_0}$

**The risk of outbreaks** is:

$$1 - \mathbb{P}\text{(ultimate extinction)} = 1 - q = 1 - \frac{1}{R_0}$$

## Why $G(q) = q$?

**Lemma:** Let $q_n = \mathbb{P}(Z_n = 0)$ (probability of extinction by generation n). Then $q_n = G(q_{n - 1})$

**Proof:**

$G_n(s)$ is the PGF of $Z_n$, then $G_n(0) = \mathbb{P}(Z_n = 0)$. So $q_n = \mathbb{P}(Z_n = 0) = G_n(0)$. Similarly, $q_{n - 1} = \mathbb{P}(Z_{n - 1} = 0) = G_{n - 1}(0)$

Now $G_n(0) = \underbrace{G(G(G(...G}_\text{n times}(0)...))) = G(G_{n - 1}(0))$

Because $q_{n - 1} = G_{n - 1}(0)$

So $q_n = G_n(0) = G(G_{n - 1}(0)) = G(q_{n - 1})$

## Summary: the PGF method

1. Define your stochastic model / branching process

2. Derive the offspring distribution

3. Get the PGF $G_X(s)$ of the offspring distribution

4. Solve $G_X(q) = q$ for the ultimate extinction probability $q$

5. **The risk of outbreaks** is $1 - q$

## First-step analysis (1)

Conditioning on the first event.

![](img/galton_watson.png){fig-align="center"}

The first event can only be either (i) an infection or (ii) a removal.

## First-step analysis (2)

$\mathbb{P}\text{(no outbreak)} = \mathbb{P}(\text{no outbreak} \cap \text{1st is infection})$

$+ \mathbb{P}(\text{no outbreak} \cap \text{1st is removal})$

$= \mathbb{P}(\text{no outbreak | 1st is infection}) \times \mathbb{P}(\text{1st is infection})$

$+ \mathbb{P}(\text{no outbreak | 1st is removal}) \times \mathbb{P}(\text{1st is removal})$

## First-step analysis (3)

Let call:

* $q_0 = \mathbb{P}(\text{no outbreak | 0 infection}) = 1$

* $q_1 = \mathbb{P}(\text{no outbreak | 1 infection})$

* $q_2 = \mathbb{P}(\text{no outbreak | 2 infections})$

## First-step analysis (4)

![](img/galton_watson.png){fig-align="center"}

Our model is the branching process start from 1 infection, so we are computing $q_1$.

## First-step analysis (5)

$\mathbb{P}\text{(no outbreak)} =$

$= \mathbb{P}(\text{no outbreak | 1st is infection}) \times \mathbb{P}(\text{1st is infection})$

$+ \mathbb{P}(\text{no outbreak | 1st is removal}) \times \mathbb{P}(\text{1st is removal})$

* $\mathbb{P}\text{(no outbreak)} = q_1$

* $\mathbb{P}(\text{no outbreak | 1st is infection}) = q_2$

* $\mathbb{P}(\text{1st is infection}) = \frac{\beta}{\beta + \gamma}$

* $\mathbb{P}(\text{no outbreak | 1st is removal}) = q_0 = 1$

* $\mathbb{P}(\text{1st is removal}) = \frac{\gamma}{\beta + \gamma}$

## First-step analysis (6)

$$q_1 = \frac{\beta}{\beta + \gamma} q_2 + \frac{\gamma}{\beta + \gamma}$$

In branching process, individuals are independently generates new infections, so $q_2 = q_1^2$.

$$q_1 = \frac{\beta}{\beta + \gamma} q_1^2 + \frac{\gamma}{\beta + \gamma}$$

Solve this we also get $q_1 = 1$ or $q_1 = \frac{\gamma}{\beta} = \frac{1}{R_0}$.

# More complex epidemiological models

## Gamma distributed infectious period

Using constant removal rate assume that the infectious period is **exponentially distributed**.

```{mermaid}

We split the I compartment into n subcompartments, as a **gamma distribution** with shape n and rate $\lambda$ (Erlang distribution) can be thought of as the **sum of n exponential distributions** each with rate $\lambda$.

```

## The $SI_{n}R$ model (1)

1. Define your stochastic model / branching process: $SI_{n}R$ model

2. Derive the offspring distribution

* The offspring distribution is also a **geometric distribution** with success probability $\frac{1}{\frac{R_0}{n} + 1}$.

* Because the host is expected to spend 1/n infectious period in each of the infectious compartments.

## The $SI_{n}R$ model (2)

3. Get the PGF $G_X(s)$ of the offspring distribution

* $G_X(s) = \left( \frac{1}{\frac{R_0}{n} + 1 - s \frac{R_0}{n}} \right)^n$

4. Solve $G_X(q) = q$ for the ultimate extinction probability $q$

* $q = \left( \frac{1}{\frac{R_0}{n} + 1 - q \frac{R_0}{n}} \right)^n$

## The $SI_{n}R$ model

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
solve_q <- function(R0, n){
  # define the equation
  f <- function(q) (1 / ((R0 / n) + 1 - q * (R0 / n))^n) - q
  
  # use uniroot function to find the root of the equation
  result <- uniroot(f, lower=0, upper=0.999)$root
  
  return(result)
}

R0 <- 2
n <- seq(0.001, 5, 0.001)

  q[i] <- solve_q(R0, n[i])
}

# Metrics for assessing the risk of outbreaks

## Instantaneous Outbreak Risk (IOR)

The risk that an imported case initiates an outbreak as opposed to the virus simply fading out, under the assumption that **pathogen transmissibility is fixed** at its value when the imported case enters the population

## Case Outbreak Risk (COR)

## Simulated Outbreak Risk (SOR)

Simulating the stochastic model 10,000 times starting from 1 infected individual

SOR = the proportion of simulations in which the number of infected hosts exceeds a pre-defined threshold value (e.g. 100 cases)

## Numerical Outbreak Risk (NOR)
